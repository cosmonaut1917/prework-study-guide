## Description

This study guide was created for people going through the bootcamp prework. It has notes on HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and GIT.

- What was your motivation? My motivation was to make a study guide to help me guide myself through the bootcamp to learn full stack programming.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I built this project as a way to store my notes on HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and GIT as well as a way to start learning the basics of each language.
- What problem does it solve? The problem this solves is letting me have all my notes in one place aswell as letting me get my feet wet in to programming and learning the fundementials of fullstack.
- What did you learn? I learned how to program with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and GIT as well as what each language does for a website and  why each one is an important step in the web development process.
